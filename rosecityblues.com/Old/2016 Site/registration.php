<p class="header">Donations</p>

<p class="base">Thank you for considering donating to our event! Your cash donations will used to fund the scholarships we offer to dancers in need. In the past, we have been able to provide more scholarships than originally planned for, in large part due to your generosity! There will be an option for registrants and other interested patrons to donate to our scholarship fund. Every $134 raised will allow Rose City Blues to offer one more scholarship. For more information on our scholarships, please see the next section.</p>

<p class="base">No event is complete without good food, and Rose City Blues aims to please. Portland is known for its excellent coffee, fun restaurants and eclectic food carts- attendees of RCB will have the opportunity to experience all three! Rose City Blues is a community event above all else, as such any and all donations are welcome. Food (especially coffee!) and paper goods (napkins, cups and the like) are always needed. Any donation made to Rose City Blues is completely tax deductible and greatly appreciated!

<p class="header">Scholarships</p>

<p class="base">As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the Portland Blues and Jazz Dance Society (PB&J) is dedicated to spreading knowledge about blues dancing and to supporting dance competition. As a part of PB&J, Rose City Blues is able to extend significant scholarships to those otherwise unable to participate.</p>

<p class="base">Rose City Blues is able to offer up to twelve (12) workshop passes for low-income dancers dedicated to furthering their training in blues dancing. Scholarship recipients will pay $65 (the cost of a dance-only pass) and receive a full weekend pass. There will be an option for registrants and other interested patrons to donate to our scholarship fund. Every $134 raised allows Rose City Blues to offer one additional scholarship. There is no limit to the number of scholarships which may be offered. Any donor contributing $50 or more will have the option to be recognized for their generosity. Donations are accepted during the registration process or anytime after your registration is completed.
