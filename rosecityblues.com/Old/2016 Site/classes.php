<p class="basepadded"><em>3:00pm - 4:15pm (Rhythm, All levels)</em><br>
  <strong>Cool Rhythms for Hot Dancing</strong><br>
You know that blues is rhythmically driven.  So why is so much of your dancing just a series of 2-beat steps?  Let's show some love to other beats- and some sweet syncopations!  </p>

<p class="basepadded"><em>4:30pm - 5:45pm (Musicality, Int/Advanced)</em><br>
  <strong>"Dynamicality" </strong><br>
Blues musicians are masters of repetition.  But they also make clever choices that lead to a wider range of changes and dynamics than you might not notice at a casual listen.

  <strong>The Twilight Zone</strong><br>
Blues music influenced, and was influenced by, many other styles of music.  Blues musicians today continue with that tradition, and artists like Maria Muldaur are comfortable playing everything from jazzy, small-combo pieces, to gritty electric guitar-driven juke-joint tunes, and everything in between.  We especially love songs that live in that in between space.  Welcome... to the twilight zone.</p>

  <strong>Psychic Mindpowers</strong><br>
Once upon a time, Mike realized that when she wanted to have cuddly dances, all the leads magically slipped into cuddle mode!

<p class="header">Rachel Stirling and Andrew Smith</p>

<p class="basepadded"><em>4:30pm - 5:45pm (Conceptual/Partnering, Int/Adv)</em><br>
  <strong>Conversational Dancing</strong><br>
Blues allows for a lot of self-expression, so how do we both express in a conversation without derailing each other? Here we will discover how to create a dialogue within the lead-follow structure that allows both partners to contribute equally. We will explore tricksy questions such as, “Can a follow create movement without becoming the lead?” Come join us for some dynamic back-and-forth with your partner to inspire movement and play. </p>

<p class="basepadded"><em>6:00pm - 7:15pm (Conditioning/Technique, All Levels)</em><br>
  <strong>Hang in the Balance</strong><br>

<p class="namesl40">Sunday</p>

  <strong>Tell Me A Story</strong><br>
A fundamental part of the human experience, we look at how to create story through movement, both solo and partnered. Be prepared to push your comfort level in expression, to get silly and serious and try things out without knowing where they will go. We can’t promise you’ll be the next J.K. Rowling of the dance floor, but you’ll certainly have a lot of fun out there.</p>

<p class="basepadded"><em>4:15pm - 5:30pm (Dancing to the Band, All Levels)</em><br>
