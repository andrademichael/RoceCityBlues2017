      <p class="header"><a name="bd" id="bd"></a>Blues Dancing</p>
 
  <p class="namesl40">What is blues dancing?</p>
 
    <p class="basepadded">Blues initially evolved in casual dance communities, shaped from a desire to express the soul of the music from which we take the name of the dance (blues!). Due to the decentralized nature of the dance's origins, folks tend to have their own definition of what, exactly, the dance happens to be. </p>
    <p class="basepadded">In general, blues is a free-form style of social dancing that relies more on the connection with one’s partner than on having a set pattern of movements both (or all) participants know. Through this emphasis on a strong capacity to connect and communicate, dancers are given the freedom to turn their dance into a conversation, and from there, an unparalleled freedom of expression. Blues music itself contains an immense range of emotions, and blues dancing has the capacity to convey the same through partnered movement: from small and somber to big and celebratory, and everything in between.</p>
    <p class="basepadded">For more information, we recommend the following pages: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_dance" target="_new">Wikipedia entry</a>, <a href="http://www.blues-dance.com/aboutbluesdance/" target="_new">blues-dance.com</a>, <a href="http://www.2005.bluesdance.org.uk/32161/index.html" target="_new">For Blues Dancers</a>, <a href="http://www.bluesinheidelberg.com/whatis.html" target="_new">Blues in Heidelberg</a>. </p>
   
        
        <p class="namesl40">Where can I find more blues dancing in Portland?</p>
   
  <p class="basepadded">PB&J hosts a weekly blues dance every Tuesday, aptly named Tuesday Blues. You can find out more information on this and other PB&J events at <a href="http://www.pdxblues.com" target="_new">pdxblues.com</a>. </p>

  <p class="namesl40">What is PB&J?  What is your mission?</p>
 
  <p class="basepadded"><a href="http://pdxblues.com/about-us/" target="_new">PB&J is a Portland-based 501(c)(3)</a> non-profit dedicated to spreading the love of blues dance. Our mission statement is as follows: </p>
    <p class="basepadded">The Portland Blues and Jazz Dance Society (PB&J Dance Society) exists to create a safe, sustainable, and vibrant Blues and Jazz dance community through the free exchange of ideas, utilization of community knowledge, and promotion by example.  PB&J Dance Society seeks to reignite public interest in partnered dancing and grow Blues as a dance form through the exploration of various styles of movement and promotion of both solo and partnered social dancing.</p>
   
        
        <p class="namesl40">Why does being a non-profit matter?</p>
   
  <p class="basepadded"><em>Because community involvement and support matters.</em> It's important that events are driven by the common interests of the community, not just one or two people.</p>
        <p class="basepadded"><em>Because how your money is spent matters.</em> Every dollar of our event is being fed back directly into you – our community – and the thing you love to do – blues dance.</p>
        <p class="basepadded"><em>Because dedication to the blues community matters. </em> Our mission is to grow Blues as a dance form.  Our clear dedication - exemplified by our non-profit status - matters to the success of this event and to the strength of our community.</p>

Donations of clipboards, paper, and other office supplies as well as advertising services (such as flier printing) are also wonderful. We also greatly appreciate monetary contributions, which allow us to lower costs and increase scholarships.</p>

        <p class="basepadded">Yes! Any donation made to Rose City Blues is completely tax deductible.</p>

        <p class="basepadded">You can also reduce the cost of your trip by seeking local, free housing (sign up through registration or email <a href="mailto:housing@rosecityblues.com">housing@rosecityblues.com</a> with questions).</p>
         
         
<p class="namesl40">What are the scholarship opportunities?</p>

There will be an option for registrants and other interested patrons to donate to our scholarship fund. Every $134 raised allows Rose City Blues to offer one additional scholarship. There is no limit to the number of scholarships which may be offered. Any donor contributing $50 or more will have the option to be recognized for their generosity. Donations are accepted during the registration process or anytime after your registration is completed. If you would like to contribute, but aren’t going to be registering for this event, please contact us at  <a href="mailto:scholarships@rosecityblues.com">scholarships@rosecityblues.com</a>. </p>

<p class="basepadded">Dancers applying for scholarships are required to fill out an application explaining their financial need, their current experience and training as a blues dancer, and what motivates them to attend the weekend workshops at RCB. Scholarship recipients will be expected to attend a minimum of seven out of ten workshops through the event.</p>

<p class="basepadded">All questions and concerns, and individuals potentially interested in applying for the scholarship, should contact <a href="mailto:scholarships@rosecityblues.com">scholarships@rosecityblues.com</a>.</p>

<p class="namesl40">I am a new/inexperienced dancer.  Is there a place for me at this event?</p>
 
<p class="basepadded">Yes!  After a full weekend of dancing, you will be amazed by the increase in your comfort and ability!</p>
   
        
<p class="namesl40">I am an experienced dancer.  Is there a place for me at this event?</p>
   
<p class="basepadded">Yes! We plan to have self-filtering classes, in longer time blocks, to be taught at a higher experience level. Our instructors know that advanced students want to be challenged and will be teaching their classes with that in mind. We look forward to giving you instruction that pushes you! Look for more on our <a href="classes.php">Class Information</a> page.</p>
         
        
<p class="namesl40">What will the rest of the classes be like?</p>
   
<p class="basepadded">Aside from the special solo, competition, or self-filtering classes, general classes will be targeted toward intermediate dancers, and will focus on fundamental blues partner dance technique.

<p class="header"><a name="comp" id="comp"></a>Competitions Prizes and Other Dance Scholarships</p>
 
<p class="namesl40">Why are you holding competitions?</p>
 
<p class="basepadded">The Portland Blues & Jazz Dance Society is a sports non-profit, as such competition is a component of our core required activities. More than just a requirement, however, we feel friendly competition motivates the blues scene to progress its dance skill and gives participants a sense of achievement. Competition is also a means through which PB&J can provide scholarships as prizes.</p>
   
        
<p class="namesl40">Prizes are scholarships?</p>
   
<p class="basepadded">Yes! Competitions require competitors to display a level of mastery of blues dance and dance performance, implying a devotion to furthering their own abilities and the dance itself. While not a perfect means of distribution, we intend these prizes to act as scholarships to further competitors' education in blues and jazz dances.</p>
         
        
<p class="namesl40">Who is eligible to compete?</p>
   
<p class="basepadded">All those who are not instructors are eligible to compete.  Entrance will be $10 per person per comp. You can <a href="competitions.php">register for competitions</a> at the event, or online during your initial registration..</p>
         
        
<p class="namesl40">Where can I find competition details?</p>
   
<p class="basepadded">Competition Rules and Regulations, as well as required Waivers will be posted on the <a href="competitions.php">competitions section of our website</a>.</p>
         
        
<p class="namesl40">Are other (non-competition) dance scholarships available?</p>
   
<p class="basepadded">Yes!  If you are interested in pursuing a scholarship, either to attend Rose City Blues, to participate in the competition, or to pursue blues dancing in Portland, please email us at <a href="mailto:scholarships@rosecityblues.com">scholarships@rosecityblues.com</a> for a scholarship application.
