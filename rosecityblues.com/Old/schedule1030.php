<p class="header">Schedule</p>

<p class="base">For those attending workshops, youâ€™ll want to wear comfortable clothing that you can move in easily and whatever footwear you will be most comfortable dancing in. We suggest also bringing a snack for between classes, something to drink, and a change of clothes. </p>

<p class="base">For those attending dances (especially important for live acts), please remember to bring your groove. Dancers who do not bring their groove may be unable to enjoy the maximum range of "bluesery" available at the event. Dancers who have lost, misplaced, or lightly damaged their groove(s) should report to the front desk for masking tape and a hug..</p>
