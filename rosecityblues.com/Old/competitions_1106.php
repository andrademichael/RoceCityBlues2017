The Portland Blues & Jazz Dance Society is a sports non-profit, as such competition is a component of our core required activities. More than just a requirement, however, we feel friendly competition motivates the blues scene to progress its dance skill and gives participants a sense of achievement. Competition is also a means through which PB&J can provide scholarships as prizes.<br />
<br />
<em>To participate in our competitions, you <strong>must</strong> be registered for the event. During the registration process there is are options to sign up for individual competitions. Judging will be courtesy of the instruction team.</em></p>
