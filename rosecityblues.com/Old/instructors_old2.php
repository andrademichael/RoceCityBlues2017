        <p class="base">Brenda is fulfilling her childhood dream as a professional dancer and instructor. She studies African American street dances from the turn of the century to the present. She travels around the world teaching and training with various coaches and historians. Her strength is breaking down the dances in a way that is accessible for anyone, even if they don’t have a dance background. She strives to help her students find the dancer within themselves, taking inspiration from dancers of the past. Brenda is working with the Blues dance community during this time of growth to develop curriculum and events that raise the community’s level of dancing. Her hope is to provide structure for duplicable material, while keeping the inherent character and nature of the dance.</p>

        <p class="base">Catherine was born and raised in Paris. Her first taste and experience with dance was in her household where she saw her parents from Guadeloupe, West Indies, dance Zouk, Compas, Biguine, and Gwo Ka.  She also had the chance to live in Guadeloupe for a year, in which she deeply experienced and understood the partner dances of the Caribbean.  After a year in Guadeloupe, Catherine developed a keen and curious eye for movements.  While in nursing school, she studied West African dance in Paris.</p>
<p class="base">She studied under Norma Claire, whom Catherine calls her mentor, and whose pedagogy enabled her to explore every part of her body in order to combine physical sensations and observations.  With this powerful tool, Catherine continued her training in African dance with Elsa Wolliaston, Hawa Kouyaté, Koffi Koko, Moustapha Bangouroura, Mouminatou Camara, and traveled to Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Guinée to polish her art.  Catherine also spent five years at a professional dance school in Paris where she studied Modern, Jazz, contemporary, and anatomy. </p>

Whether claiming a spot in the corner at Duff's Garage, 'peacocking' in a jam circle at Bossa Nova or hollering raucously at the Blue Diamond, there's something uniquely intoxicating about the blues in Portland that Jae tries to recreate in his dance.  His experiences in the international dance community have exposed him to a wealth of ideas and it's his pleasure to share with others. Jae seeks to follow in the footsteps of his mentors by inspiring students to feel comfortable taking ownership of their dance. Let's learn to find the joy in expressing ourselves through movement.</p>
        
<p class="base">Kayce is a home-grown Portland-blues-dancer-turned-future-doctor who finds nothing more wonderful than sharing a good dance to great music.  Whether it's introducing music fundamentals, diving into body mechanics, or just helping students find joy in their dance, Kayce delights in crafting classes that fit her audience's needs and abilities- and she's done so across the US and around the world! Want to know more?  She'll see you on the dance floor.</p>
