Rose City Blues is hosting three competitions this year. These will be a Jack and Jill, a Strictly, and a Solo Movement Competitions. All competitions have an entry fee of $10 per person. Now, here's the best part:<br />
<br />


<strong>There will be over $2,500 in cash prizes, with $1,000 going to the winning couple of the Strictly Competition!</strong><br />
<br />
In addition to prize money, you are competing for passes to blues events across the country, including the epic <a href="http://www.austinbluesparty.com/contests.html" target="new">Austin Blues Party</a>. <br>
<br />
<br />
Don't miss your chance to show off your dance moves for your community and try for the big prize!<br />
<br />
The Portland Blues & Jazz Dance Society is a sports non-profit, as such competition is a component of our core required activities. More than just a requirement, however, we feel friendly competition motivates the blues scene to progress its dance skill and gives participants a sense of achievement. Competition is also a means through which PB&J can provide scholarships as prizes.<br />
<br />
<em>To participate in our competitions, you <strong>must</strong> be registered for the event. During the registration process there is are options to sign up for individual competitions.</em></p>
