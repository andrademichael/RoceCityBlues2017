<p class="namescenter">Private lessons: <a href="mailto:redstirling@gmail.com"basepadded"">redstirling@gmail.com</a></p>
<p class="basepadded">It was Pittsburgh, 2003 when Rachel got her first taste of blues dancing, shortly after getting hooked on lindy hop.  She fell in love with the intimate connection between your partner and the music and all that hip movement.  As her blues dancing has grown, she continues to marvel at the unlimited possibilities of self-expression and movement.  She enjoys sharing that joy through teaching, djing, performing, and kicking so much ass in competitions.<br><br>

When teaching dance, Rachel loves putting her Penn State degree in education to good use.  Known for her incredible patience and ability to explain and demonstrate concepts in a variety of ways, she strives to get those "Aha!" moments.  Rooted in strong fundamentals and clean technique, her lessons enjoy finding fun ways to sneak that focus into peoples' dancing. As a regional and national instructor, dj, and scene organizer, Rachel is spreading her love of Blues from coast to coast.

        <p class="base">Though Jae has spent over a decade dancing across Europe and the United States, he claims Portland, OR as his blues spiritual home. Whether claiming a spot in the corner at Duff's Garage, 'peacocking' in a jam circle at Bossa Nova or hollering raucously at the Blue Diamond, there's something uniquely intoxicating about the blues in Portland that Jae tries to recreate in his dance.  His experiences in the international dance community have exposed him to a wealth of ideas and it's his pleasure to share with others. Jae seeks to follow in the footsteps of his mentors by inspiring students to feel comfortable taking ownership of their dance. Let's learn to find the joy in expressing ourselves through movement.<br></p>
